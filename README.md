## What is the Problem?
In order to demonstrate knowledge in databases, we have been asked to design a database for a mock university. The database created includes professors, students, departments, courses, sections, and enrollment records.

---
## What Am I Offering?
This project solves the above problem as I created a simple Web Application that connects to a MariaDB database of a university that I also created. This web application utilizes a HTML Front-End and a PHP Back-End which displays the results from the database to the user.

## The Database
As mentioned, the database is utilized with MariaDB. Here are screenshots of the database: <br/><br/>

## Examples
This program can only effectively work when connected to this online database linked with CSUF. Therefore, it is impossible to connect to the database locally. Due to this, example runs are provided below: <br/><br/>
