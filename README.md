## What is the Problem?
In order to demonstrate knowledge in databases, we have been asked to design a database for a mock university. The database created includes professors, students, departments, courses, sections, and enrollment records.

## What Am I Offering?
This project solves the above problem as I created a simple Web Application that connects to a MariaDB database of a university that I also created. This web application utilizes a HTML Front-End and a PHP Back-End which displays the results from the database to the user.
